CARLA Self-Driving RL Project

This project explores the basics of training a self-driving agent using reinforcement learning in the CARLA simulator. The current setup involves teaching an agent to follow a lead vehicle using visual input from a front-facing camera.
Project Goals

    Set up a simulation environment in CARLA

    Stream and process camera data in real time

    Train a reinforcement learning agent to follow another vehicle

    Experiment with reward functions and control strategies

Current Status

The environment is set up and running, with a working perception pipeline and a basic RL training loop. Still tuning rewards and training stability â€” very much a work in progress.
Tech Stack

    Python

    CARLA Simulator

    OpenCV (for basic image processing)

    Stable-Baselines3 (for RL algorithms)

    PyTorch / TensorFlow (optional for custom models)

Notes

This project is more about learning and experimentation than production-level autonomy. Feedback and ideas welcome!
